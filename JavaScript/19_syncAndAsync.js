//sync vs async behaviour:
//synchronous behavior: Execute the code in linear order. It Takes more time as each step needs to be completed before moving to next step.
//asynchronous behaviour: Will run the other steps in background so it takes less time for the whole program to comlete. We use setTimeout function for async implementation.

//sync api vs aysnc api
